Aforementioned React App utilazes external RDS Postgres and ElastiCash for Redis.

## Variation 1

**Prerequisites** 

- User whith programmatic access to AWS.
- Existing AWS ECS Cluster with corresponding service and initiated task-definition.
- Running AWS RDS Postgres instance.
- Running AWS ElastiCash for Redis.

_*Please note that you could be charged for usage of those services._

Following **secrets** should exist in GitHub repository settings:
- for AWS configure
  - ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - AWS_REGION
- for Dockerhub login
  - DOCKER_ID
  - DOCKER_PASSWORD

This CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions to create a new revision of the task-definition and subsiquently update a corresponding service inside ECS cluster via AWS CLI.

_Note! Test, Build & Push phases were removed from this version of the pipeline. Look at them in **Variation 2**._ 

## Variation 2

**Prerequisites** 

- User whith programmatic access to AWS.
- Elastic Beanstalk with created Application and Environment for Multi container Docker App.
- S3 for keeping zip files for Elastic Beanstalk.
- Dockerhub account for images.
- Running AWS RDS Postgres instance.
- Running AWS ElastiCash for Redis.

_*Please note that you could be charged for usage of those services._

Following **secrets** should exist in to GitHub repository settings:
- for AWS configure
  - ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - AWS_REGION
- for Dockerhub login
  - DOCKER_ID
  - DOCKER_PASSWORD
- RDS Postgres credentials
  - POSTGRES_USER
  - POSTGRES_PASSWORD

This **Variation 2** of CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions to create a new version of AWS Elastic Beanstalk Multi-Docker Environment and subsiquent deploy. 

[This is the source code of Variation 2](https://github.com/kkkooosss/React-app-for-multi-docker-CI-CD-deployment-to-ecs).

[The **Variation 2** via AWS CLI created on Bitbacket-pipeline ](https://bitbucket.org/ConstConst/react-app-for-multi-docker-ci-cd-deployment-to/src/master/).

[*The **Variation 2** based on Travis-CI could be found here (original code by Stephen Grider)](https://github.com/kkkooosss/React-app-for-multi-docker-CI-CD-deployment-to-elasticbeanstalk-aws-with-travis).
